# Adaptive-Auto-regressive-Model-for-Guided-Depth-Map-Restoration
This is the C implementation of the paper "Color-guided Depth Recovery from RGB-D Data  Using an Adaptive Auto-regressive Model" in TIP 2014. It is the same as the MATLAB source code provided by the author. However, it can run much faster and can handle much larger depth maps.
